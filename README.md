# 💼 Income Predictor 

Predicting whether someone earns >$50K/year using classic & cutting-edge machine learning models. Powered by the 1994 UCI Adult Census dataset 📊.

## 🔍 Project Scope
Build, compare, and evaluate multiple ML models to classify income level:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree 🌳
- Random Forest
- XGBoost ⚡
- SVM
- Neural Network 🧠

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
✔️ Accuracy  
🎯 Sensitivity (Recall for >50K)  
🛡️ Specificity (Recall for ≤50K)  
📉 Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Highlights
- Dummy encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling for numerical stability
- (Optional) SMOTE for class balance
- Feature selection via correlation & importance scores
